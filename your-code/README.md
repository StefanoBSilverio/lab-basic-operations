# Lab | Intro to Python with Bag of Words

## Introduction

In this lab, we will practice a few fundamental Python concepts. We will use as motivation the creation of something called a Bag of Words (BoW) model. BoW is an essential technique in Natural Language Processing which we will cover in Module 3. For the time being, **you don't need to fully understand how a Bag of Words is used or even what it is in detail**. The exercise serves for you to train for loops and lists and strings. The Natural Language Processing stuff is just the backdrop, you'll have plenty of time to delve into that.
 

### Getting Started

In your Terminal, navigate into the directory `your-code` of this lab that contains `main.ipynb`, `doc1.txt`, `doc2.txt`, and `doc3.txt`. Start Jupyter Notebook by executing `jupyter notebook`. A webpage should automatically open for you but in case not, go to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). Then click the link to each ipynb file to complete the challenges.

## Deliverables

`main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then git commit, push your branch to the remote and make a merge request as taught in class.

## Additional Reading

If you are a research-type person, you will find [this article](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/366/1567/1101.full.pdf) interesting. Scientists used techniques based on BoW to calculate the frequency of words used cross 17 world languages. They found there is a consistent pattern in terms of the frequency of words being used in human languages. Some mad scientists even [want to use this technique to analyze dolphin language](http://grantome.com/grant/NSF/PHY-1530544) because they believe they can build corpora based on the sounds dolphins make, correlate the dolphin language corpora with human language corpora, and potentially understand what dolphins speak. :astonished: :astonished: :astonished:
